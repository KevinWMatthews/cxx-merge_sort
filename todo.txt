Add notes on gotchas:
    stability: < vs <=
    Overflow: (low+high)/2 vs (low + (hi - low) / 2)
    Merge only works with an array with an equal number of elements?
        Recursion is required otherwise.
    Iterators - be sure you're iterating over the correct array.
    Copy - sorted data is placed in data_. The next sort must re-populate tmp.

Add tests for stability.
(Doesn't exist with the current data type?).
